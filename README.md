# Serverless Workshop

Build your serverless knowledge from basics to leveraging strength of the platforms. This particular workshop will be using AWS but the principles (and most of the code & config) can be used cross-platform.

## Setting up

You'll need:

* AWS account
* environment variables set up on your laptop with AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (you'll find this in the IAM section of AWS)
* node and nvm (LINK)
* `nvm install && nvm use` to get the right node version
* serverless framework `npm i -g serverless@1.23.0`
* ideally yarn `npm i -g yarn`

## What you'll learn

1.  Basics. (LINK) Adding your serverless app configuration, deploying and checking your service is running.
2.  Plugins. (LINK) Extending serverless framework functionality, using webpack and babel to package your functions.
3.  Ecosystem. (LINK) Specifying custom resources, environments, using other resources than just functions & api.

## Solutions

Solutions to all exercises will be available in a pull request at the end of the workshop.
