# Serverless Plugins

## Why do we need plugins?

* Copy over `serverless.yml` from previous exercise
* `yarn` or `npm i`
* Deploy service as it is and try hitting the endpoint with user id 1
* Check why it failed using `sls logs -f getUser`

## How do we add plugins?

* Add webpack plugin
* Tweak webpack config
* `sls deploy -f getUser`
